            At Wild Paw, we’re committed to providing dogs with food that’s
            as natural as it is nourishing. Inspired by the instinctive spirit
            of every dog, Wild Paw&trade; stands for a return to simple, honest
            nutrition. We use only ingredients we’d choose for our own dogs.
            Each bite is packed with premium proteins, essential nutrients,
            and wholesome goodness.
